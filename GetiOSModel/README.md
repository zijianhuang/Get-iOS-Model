## Changes in Fork

1. Simplify code structure, with DeviceInfo.json replacing if-ten and dictionary, so updating the mapping will be just updating the JSON file while the programming interfaces remain the same to Xamarin App developers.
2. The mapping could be used in a lookup Web service in addition to iOS app.

**Remarks**
DotNet has poor support for NuGet with content files, while there are a few workarounds like this one at https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2018/Jan/29/Distributing-Content-and-Showing-a-ReadMe-file-in-a-NET-Core-Nuget-Package.

## Install
